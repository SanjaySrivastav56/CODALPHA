Web Scraping Project â€“ BooksToScrape

**Internship Task â€“ CodeAlpha | Data Analytics**

This project is a part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**, where I explored the basics of web scraping using Python.  
I scraped real-time book data (title, price, and rating) from [BooksToScrape.com](http://books.toscrape.com), a website made specifically for practicing web scraping.

Project Objective

- Extract structured data (title, price, rating) from an e-commerce-style website
- Store the scraped data into a CSV file
- Visualize the data using charts

 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- requests
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn 

Data Collected

From 5 pages of the website, the following details were scraped:

- Book Title
- Price (in Â£)
- Rating (e.g., One, Two, Three, Four, Five)

Insights

- Most books are rated as "Three".
- The majority of book prices fall between Â£20â€“Â£40.
