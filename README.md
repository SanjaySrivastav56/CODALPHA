# Titanic EDA Project — CodeAlpha Internship

Welcome! This is my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project submitted as part of my **Data Analytics Internship with CodeAlpha**

In this project, I’ve explored the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Project Objectives

- Understand the structure of the Titanic dataset
- Clean and handle missing data
- Analyze survival rates based on different features (gender, class, age, etc.)
- Visualize the findings with clear and informative charts

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Google Colab
